# Reactickles3
The next version of Reactickles - built for the WWW in p5.js

[Blog posts](http://joelgethinlewis.com/category/projects/reactickles-3/) about the project.

[Demonstration code](https://jgl.github.io/Reactickles3/) hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This project is built in HTML and JavaScript. The main platform I am using is [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) - thanks to [Paolo Pedercini](https://twitter.com/molleindustria) for creating [p5.play](https://github.com/molleindustria/p5.play/) which Reactickles3 uses to display animations on the menu page.
